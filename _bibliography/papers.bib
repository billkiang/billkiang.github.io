  title={Weak antilocalization of two-dimensional hole gases in a modulation-doped GeSn/Ge heterostructure},
  author={Chen, Ze-Wei and Kiang, Chou-Wei and Tai, Chia-Tse and Wang, Hao-Chien and Lin, Min-Jui and Chuang, Yen and Li, Jiun-Yun},
  abstract={GeSn shows strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and is a promising material for quantum and spintronics applications, such as fast spin qubits and spin field-effect transistors. In this work, we demonstrate weak antilocalization (WAL) in modulation-doped Ge\(_\{0.94\}\)Sn\(_\{0.06\}\)/Ge heterostructure. We characterize the carrier transport properties by performing Hall measurements at 40 mK with the highest mobility of \( \sim 32,000 \\ \) cm\(^2\)/V-s. We observe WAL patterns at a carrier density of \( 3.3 \times 10^\{11\} \\ \) cm\(^\{-2\}\). By fitting WAL patterns to the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) model, we extract spin relaxation time (\(\sim 14 \\ \) ps) and length (\( \sim 0.67 \mu\)m). We also observe clear quantum Hall plateausand Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations starting from a filling factor of 22 at a magnetic field of 0.67T. The longitudinal resistance reaches zero at filling factors of 4 and 2, indicating the high material quality of the GeSn/Ge heterostructure. We show that there is no parallel conduction in this modulation-doped heterostructure by comparing the carrier densities from the low-field measurements and fast Fourier transform of the data of SdH oscillations. },

  title={Conductance anomalies in nanoscale quantum point contact devices on an undoped GeSn/Ge heterostructure},
  author={Wu, Yu-Jui and Kiang, Chou-Wei and Li, Tsung-Ying and Chen, Ze-Wei and Lin, Min-Jui and Kao, Wei-Hsiang and Li, Jiun-Yun},
  abstract={GeSn is a promising material for quantum and spintronic applications due to its strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strengths. In this work, we present quantized conductance in a gated quantum point contact (QPC) device on an undoped Ge\(_\{0.94\}\)Sn\(_\{0.06\}\)/Ge heterostructure. We perform DC measurements at 1.5K to verify the control ability of split gates in the QPC device. We then perform differential-conductance measurements at 120 mK and characterize the nonlinear transport properties by sweeping the source-to-drain bias under different split-gate voltages. We observed 0.7\(G_0 \\ \) and 0.35\(G_0 \\ \) zero-bias conductance anomalies without an external magnetic field. By applying an out-of-plane magnetic field of 3T, clearer 0.7\(G_0 \\ \) and 0.35\(G_0 \\ \) conductance plateaus are observed. Under a magnetic field of 8T, we observed a clear 0.5\(G_0 \\ \) plateau, which might be attributed to the lifted spin degeneracy by the Zeeman effect. },
