I am a first-year PhD student in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am currently working in the [Laboratory for Integrated Nano-Quantum Systems (LINQS)](https://linqs.stanford.edu/), advised by [Prof. Amir Safavi-Naeini](https://linqs.stanford.edu/people/amir-safavi-naeini). My research at Stanford is being graciously supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the EE Departmental Fellowship. 

My main research interest is in quantum engineering, where I currently focus on quantum acoustics, exploring the physics and applications of superconducting circuits and optomechanical devices.

Before coming to Stanford, I received my B.S. in electrical engineering at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) in June 2022. During my days at NTU, I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Jiun-Yun Li](https://sites.google.com/g.ntu.edu.tw/jiunyun/members/advisor) on characterizing semiconductor quantum devices, and [Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/) on remote sensing and quantum sensing.



<!-- I am a research assistant in the [Quantum Electronics Laboratory (QEL)](https://sites.google.com/g.ntu.edu.tw/jiunyun/home) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by . In the QEL, my research focuses on cryogenic measurements and characterizations of quantum point contact (QPC) devices and 2D hole gases in GeSn/Ge heterostructures. 

 on modeling and simulations of wavelet-based quantum sensing to reconstruct geomagnetic field fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles, as well as synthetic aperture sonar and radar imaging of moving vehicles. -->
