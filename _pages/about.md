I am a research assistant working in the Quantum Electronics Laboratory (QEL) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by Prof. Jiun-Yun Li. My research focus in the QEL is the measurement and characterization of GeSn spintronic and quantum point contact (QPC) devices for quantum computing. 

I am applying for EECS Ph.D. in the U.S. for Fall 2024.

Before joining the QEL, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at NTU in June 2022. 
I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang on quantum sensing of geomagnetic field fluctuations
and spin-bath noise spectroscopy of NV ensembles, 
as well as synthetic aperture sonar and radar imaging of moving vehicles.
